# educational-site
This is my first front-end web development project based entirely on HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. 
This is a website for an educational platform designed to enhance learning experiences. It includes interactive features, resources for students, and tools for educators, aimed at creating an engaging and user-friendly environment for academic growth.
Features include:
Home Page: A welcoming introduction to the platform.
About Us Page: Learn the story behind the project and its mission.
Curriculum & Courses: Explore detailed course offerings designed for learners of all levels.
Enroll Section: Seamlessly sign up for courses.
Team Page: Meet the passionate individuals behind this initiative.
Contact Page: Get in touch for inquiries or collaborations.
Reviews Section: Hear from others who have engaged with the platform.
